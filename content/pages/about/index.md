Hi, my name is Arthur Rump ðŸ‘‹

I tell computers what to do, and sometimes they listen. I also teach others how to do the same, and sometimes even they listen. Professionally that means:

- I'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en) working on automation support for the assessment of open-ended assignments
- I teach informatics to high school students at the [Q-highschool](https://q-highschool.nl/)

I generally enjoy making things, both physically and digitally. You'll find most of the latter on this site. You can also find me in other places, including:

- For code: [GitHub](https://github.com/arthurrump/)
- For "professional networking": [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurrump)
- For research: [ORCID Registry](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4880-4994) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ogDht6EAAAAJ)
- For videos: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUTcNWxjKLUj9JFyHvaynCQ) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/arthurrump)

I'm also on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@arthurrump), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/arthurrump), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arthurrump), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/story/arthurrump), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@arthurrump_2768599), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/arthurrump), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/arthurrump), [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/arthurrump) and probably some others I have forgotten about.
