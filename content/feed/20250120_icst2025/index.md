Assessment of open-ended assignments such as programming projects is a complex and time-consuming task. When students learn to program, however, they benefit from receiving timely feedback, which requires an assessment of their current work. Our goal is to build a tool that assists in this process by partially automating the assessment of open-ended programming assignments. In this paper we discuss the requirements for this tool, based on interviews with teachers and other relevant stakeholders.
