Providing effective feedback on open-ended programming assignments is a challenge, particularly at scale. This challenge impacts student learning, as timely and accurate feedback is crucial to improve their programming and program design skills. We intend to develop an approach leveraging automation to support the feedback process, without requiring changes to assignments that enable full automation. This method aims to improve the consistency and efficiency of giving feedback, helping students learn more effectively.
