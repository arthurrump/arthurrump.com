Fake.StaticGen is a toolkit for generating static websites using [FAKE](https://fake.build) build scripts. It provides a framework for including pages and files and writing those out to disk in the correct folder structure. Fake.StaticGen tries to be very flexible and give you full control of the way you want your site to be organized, while still being helpful in common scenarios. Both this website and [versionsof.net](https://versionsof.net) are examples of what you can do with Fake.StaticGen.
