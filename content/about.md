Being born in the last year of the previous millennium, Arthur has been using computers for about as long as he can remember. It all started with an Acer Veriton FP2 all-in-one running Windows ME. He has used almost every version of Windows since then, except for Vista.

After some fiddling with GameMaker and Visual Basic, Arthur has been programming in C# since his fourteenth. Up to today, .NET remains his home, although he has switched to F# as his language of choice. While native applications will always have a special place in his hearth, the web is now his platform of choice with full-stack F# as the preferred technology. Given a good project, however, Arthur is not afraid to write code in other languages like TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, C++ or even PHP.

Besides creating many, and finishing some, side-projects, he studies Computer Science and Science Education at the University of Twente in Enschede.

Other than programming languages, Arthur also speaks Dutch, English and a tiny bit of German. When he's not programming he enjoys to read fantasy and science fiction, listen to [a good podcast](/2017/07/10/my-favorite-podcasts), play with his dogs, or write about himself in the third person.
