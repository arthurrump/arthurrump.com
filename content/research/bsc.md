With online forms of education, it has become harder to ‘gauge the room’ and get an impression of how well students are following along. We introduce Apollo, a tool that automatically analyses code uploaded by students to get an overview of their progression towards the learning objectives of the course. First, typical learning objectives in Computer Science courses are analysed on their suitability for automated assessment. A set of learning objectives is analysed further to get an understanding of what achievement of these objectives looks like in code. Finally, this is implemented in Apollo, a tool that assesses achievement of learning objectives in Processing projects. Validation of the tool is not conclusive, but early results suggest an agreement in assessment between Apollo and teaching assistants.
